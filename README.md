# N8N-AGENTIC-AI-build-ai-agent

‚ö° Why it matters in n8n

When you use n8n Agents:
- The Agent Node is the wizard.
- The Tools are the spells.
- The Memory Node is the wizard‚Äôs grimoire (keeps past knowledge).
- The Triggers are when someone calls upon the wizard for help.

And you (the builder) are the Archmage, designing the spellbook.
So calling Advanced AI a ‚ÄúDigital Wizard‚Äù is a metaphor:
# n8n - Secure Workflow Automation for Technical Teams
- n8n is a workflow automation platform that gives technical teams the flexibility of code with the speed of no-code. With 400+ integrations, native AI capabilities, and a fair-code license, n8n lets you build powerful automations while maintaining full control over your data and deployments.

## About n8n#
- n8n (pronounced n-eight-n) helps you to connect any app with an API with any other, and manipulate its data with little or no code.

## Quick Start
- Try n8n instantly with npx (requires Node.js):
  npx n8n

## Or deploy with Docker:
docker volume create n8n_data
docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
Access the editor at http://localhost:5678

This quickstart uses n8n Cloud. A free trial is available for new users.
1. Go to Templates | Very quick quickstart.
2. Select Use for free to view the options for using the template.
3. Select Get started free with n8n cloud to sign up for a new Cloud instance.

 This workflow:
1. Gets example data from the Customer Datastore node.
2. Uses the Edit Fields node to extract only the desired data and assigns that data to variables. In this example, you map the customer name, ID, and description.
3. The individual pieces in an n8n workflow are called nodes.

## üìå Overview

This repository documents **how to build agents in n8n**:  
- Detailed explanation of **nodes** (Trigger, Agent, LLM, Memory, Tools, Control).  
- Step-by-step guide to creating agents.  
- Best practices for **multi-agent systems**.  
- Example workflows (JSON) ready to import into n8n.

## üß© Node Categories

| Category | Node Examples | Purpose |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Trigger Nodes** | Webhook, Chat, Cron | Start workflows |
| **AI / LLM Nodes** | OpenAI Chat Model, Anthropic, Gemini | Generate responses |
| **Agent Node** | LangChain Agent | Orchestrates reasoning + tool usage |
| **Memory Nodes** | Chat Memory, Vector Stores | Keep past context |
| **Tool Nodes** | HTTP Request, Code, Call Workflow | Extend capabilities |
| **Logic Nodes** | IF, Switch, Merge | Flow control & branching |

## üöÄ Building an Agent (Step-by-Step)

1. **Setup**  
   - Install n8n (self-hosted or n8n Cloud).  
   - Add credentials for your LLM provider and APIs.  

2. **Define Goal & Tools**  
   - Decide the agent‚Äôs role (e.g. summarizer, researcher, task manager).  
   - Select tools (APIs, databases, workflows).  

3. **Create Workflow**  
   - Add a **Trigger Node** (Webhook/Chat).  
   - Add an **Agent Node** and connect to an LLM.  

4. **Add Tools**  
   - Connect HTTP Request, Call Workflow, or custom Code nodes.  
   - Configure input/output schemas.  

5. **Configure Memory (Optional)**  
   - Add memory for persistent context.  
   - Use vector stores for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).  

6. **Test & Iterate**  
   - Check execution logs.  
   - Refine prompts and fallback paths.

## üõ† Example Workflows

üìÇ `/workflows/` contains exported JSON files you can import directly into n8n.

- **Simple Chat Agent** ‚Äì responds to user input.  
- **Research Agent** ‚Äì scrapes a URL, summarizes, and stores results.  
- **Multi-Agent System** ‚Äì manager agent delegates tasks to worker agents.

## üí° Best Practices

‚úÖ Keep **system prompts clear** and role-specific.  
‚úÖ Restrict **tools** to only what‚Äôs required.  
‚úÖ Use **structured outputs** (JSON parser) to minimize hallucinations.  
‚úÖ Add **fallbacks** (IF/Default path) for error handling.  
‚úÖ Monitor **API usage & costs**.

## üêû Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Agent not calling tool | Ensure tool is connected & named correctly |
| Output not structured | Use JSON/Structured Output Parser node |
| Memory not working | Verify memory node setup |
| Workflow slow/expensive | Optimize prompts, reduce context, use faster model |
